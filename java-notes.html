1. Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming :
OOP concepts in Java are the main ideas behind Java's Object Oriented Programming.
Object means real-world things such as pen, paper, chair, etc. OOP is a technique that helps in
designing a program more effectively using classes and objects. It provides the following concepts.
❖ Class
❖ Object
❖ Inheritance
❖ Polymorphism
❖ Abstraction
❖ Encapsulation
Advantages
The following are the advantages of OOP over procedure-oriented programming languages:
• makes development of programs easier; in procedure-oriented languages it's difficult to
manage the coding of the program when the program increases in size.
• provides a way to interact with real-world data more effectively.
• allows development of solutions for real-world problems.
• provides hiding of codes but in a procedure-oriented language the data can be accessed
from anywhere.
2. Object oriented Paradigm
The object-oriented paradigm took its shape from the initial concept of a new
programming approach, while the interest in design and analysis methods came much later.
• The first object–oriented language was Simula (Simulation of real systems) that was
developed in 1960 by researchers at the Norwegian Computing Center.
• In 1970, Alan Kay and his research group at Xerox PARK created a personal computer
named Dynabook and the first pure object-oriented programming language (OOPL) -
Smalltalk, for programming the Dynabook.
• In the 1980s, Grady Booch published a paper titled Object Oriented Design that mainly
presented a design for the programming language, Ada. In the ensuing editions, he
extended his ideas to a complete object–oriented design method.
• In the 1990s, Coad incorporated behavioral ideas to object-oriented methods.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based upon objects (having both
data and methods) that aims to incorporate the advantages of modularity and reusability. Objects,
which are usually instances of classes, are used to interact with one another to design applications
and computer programs.
3. Basic Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming
In the class-based object-oriented programming paradigm,“object” refers to a particular
instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data
structures. A good understanding of OOPs concepts can help in decision making when designing
an application. How you should design an application and what language should be used?
Object Oriented programming is a programming style which is associated with the concepts
like class, object, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism.
Class
A class is a collection of method and variables. It is a blueprint that defines the data and
behavior of a type.
Let’s take Human Being as a class. A class is a blueprint for any functional entity which defines
its properties and its functions. Like Human Being, having body parts, performing various
actions.
We can define a class using the class keyword and the class body enclosed by a pair of curly
braces, as shown in the following example:
public class classname
{
 // declare field properties, event, delegate, and method
}
Inheritance
Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows code reusability when a
class includes property of another class. Considering HumanBeing a class, which has properties
like hands, legs, eyes, mouth, etc, and functions like walk, talk, eat, see etc.
Man and Woman are also classes, but most of the properties and functions are included in
HumanBeing. Hence, they can inherit everything from class HumanBeing using the concept of
Inheritance.
Java supports six types of inheritance as follows:
❖ Single Inheritance.
❖ Multiple Inheritance (Through Interface)
❖ Multilevel Inheritance.
❖ Hierarchical Inheritance.
❖ Hybrid Inheritance (Through Interface)
Objects
My name is Yann, and I am an instance/object of class Man. When we say, Human Being,
Man or Woman, we just mean a kind, you, your friend, and I. We are the forms of these classes.
We have a physical existence while a class is just a logical definition. We are the objects.
The syntax for creating an object of a class Man:
Man Yann = new Man();
Abstraction
Abstraction means, showcasing only the required things to the outside world while hiding
the details. Continuing our example, Human Being’s can talk, walk, hear, eat, but the details of the
muscles mechanism and their connections to the brain are hidden from the outside world.
Encapsulation
Encapsulation means that we want to hide unnecessary details from the user. For example,
when we call from our mobile phone, we select the number and press call button. But the entire
process of calling or what happens from the moment we press or touch the call button to the moment
we start having a phone conversation is hidden from us.
Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a concept, which allows us to redefine the way something works, by either
changing how it is done or by changing the parts used to get it done. This can be done in two
ways, overloading and overriding.
4. Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming
The important features of object–oriented programming are −
❖ Bottom–up approach in program design
❖ Programs organized around objects, grouped in classes
❖ Focus on data with methods to operate upon object’s data
❖ Interaction between objects through functions
❖ Reusability of design through creation of new classes by adding features to existing
classes
Some examples of object-oriented programming languages are C++, Java, Smalltalk, Delphi, C#,
Perl, Python, Ruby, and PHP.
The advantages of object-oriented programming lie in this kind of encapsulation such as:
❖ Modularity for easier troubleshooting
❖ Reuse of code through inheritance
❖ Flexibility through polymorphism
❖ Effective problem solving
❖ OOP offers easy to understand and a clear modular structure for programs.
❖ Objects created for Object-Oriented Programs can be reused in other programs. Thus
it saves significant development cost.
❖ Large programs are difficult to write, but if the development and designing team
follow OOPS concept then they can better design with minimum flaws.
❖ It also enhances program modularity because every object exists independently.
5. Applications of Object-Oriented Programming
Client-Server Systems
Object-oriented Client-Server Systems provide the IT infrastructure, creating object-oriented
Client-Server Internet (OCSI) applications. Here, infrastructure refers to operating systems,
networks, and hardware. OSCI consist of three major technologies:
❖ The Client Server
❖ Object-Oriented Programming
❖ The Internet
Object-Oriented Databases
They are also called Object Database Management Systems (ODBMS). These databases
store objects instead of data, such as real numbers and integers. Objects consist of the following:
Attributes: Attributes are data that defines the traits of an object. This data can be as simple as
integers and real numbers. It can also be a reference to a complex object.
Methods: They define the behavior and are also called functions or procedures.
Real-Time System Design
Real time systems inherit complexities that makes difficult to build them. Object-oriented
techniques make it easier to handle those complexities. These techniques present ways of dealing
with these complexities by providing an integrated framework which includes schedule analysis
and behavioral specifications.
Simulation andModeling System
It’s difficult to model complex systems due to the varying specification of variables. These
are prevalent in medicine and in other areas of natural science, such as ecology, zoology, and
agronomic systems. Simulating complex systems requires modeling and understanding
interactions explicitly. Object-oriented Programming provides an alternative approach for
simplifying these complex modeling systems.
Hypertext and Hypermedia
Hypermedia, on the other hand, is a superset of hypertext. Documents having hypermedia,
not only contain links to other pieces of text and information, but also to numerous other forms of
media, ranging from images to sound.
Neural Networking and Parallel Programming
It addresses the problem of prediction and approximation of complex time-varying
systems. Firstly, the entire time-varying process is split into several time intervals or slots. Then,
neural networks are developed in a particular time interval to disperse the load of various networks.
OOP simplifies the entire process by simplifying the approximation and prediction ability of
networks.
Office Automation Systems
These include formal as well as informal electronic systems primarily concerned with
information sharing and communication to and from people inside as well as outside the
organization. Some examples are:
❖ Email
❖ Word processing
❖ Web calendars
❖ Desktop publishing
CIM/CAD/CAM Systems
OOP can also be used in manufacturing and design applications as it allows people to
reduce the effort involved. For instance, it can be used while designing blueprints, flowcharts, etc.
OOP makes it possible for the designers and engineers to produce these flowcharts and blueprints
accurately.
AI Expert Systems
These are computer applications which are developed to solve complex problems
pertaining to a specific domain, which is at a level far beyond the reach of a human brain.
It has the following characteristics:
❖ Reliable
❖ Highly responsive
❖ Understandable
❖ High-performance
6. Java Evolution: History
❖ The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive
television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at
the time. The history of java starts with Green Team. Java team members (also known
as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as
set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was suited for internet programming. Later, Java
technology was incorporated by Netscape.
❖ The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platformindependent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, ObjectOriented, Interpreted and Dynamic".
❖ Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business
solutions, etc. There are given the significant points that describe the history of Java.
❖ James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughtoninitiated the Java language
project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.
❖ Originally designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top
boxes.
❖ Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and file extension was .gt.
❖ After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.
Why had they chosen java name for java language? The team gathered to choose a new
name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc. They
wanted something that reflected the essence of the technology: revolutionary, dynamic, lively,
cool, unique, and easy to spell and fun to say.
• According to James Gosling, "Java was one of the top choices along with Silk". Since Java
was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.
• Java is an island of Indonesia where first coffee was produced (called java coffee).
• Notice that Java is just a name, not an acronym.
• Initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of
Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.
• In 1995, Time magazine called Java one of the Ten Best Products of 1995.
• JDK 1.0 released in(January 23, 1996).
Java Version History
Many java versions have been released till now. The current stable release of Java is Java SE 10.
1. JDK Alpha and Beta (1995)
2. JDK 1.0 (23rd Jan 1996)
3. JDK 1.1 (19th Feb 1997)

7. Features
Java is a general-purpose programming language developed with the aim to bring portability
and a higher level of security. Other than these two main java features, there are many other
features of Java that make it such a unique and popular language.
List of features of Java programming languages-
❖ Simple
❖ Object-Oriented
❖ Portable
❖ Platform Independent
❖ Secured
❖ Robust
❖ Architecture Neutral
❖ Dynamic
❖ High Performance
❖ Multi-Threaded
❖ Distributed
Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun,
Java language is a simple programming language because:
o Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).
o Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicit
pointers, operator overloading, etc.
o There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic Garbage
Collection in Java.
8. How Java differs from C and C++
There are many differences and similarities between the C++ programming language
and Java. A list of top differences between C++ and Java are given below:
Comparison Index C++ Java
Platformindependent
C++ is platform-dependent. Java is platform-independent.
Mainly used for C++ is mainly used for
system programming.
Java is mainly used for application
programming. It is widely used in
window, web-based, enterprise
and mobile applications.
Design Goal C++ was designed for
systems and applications
programming. It was an
extension of C
programming language.
Java was designed and created as
an interpreter for printing systems
but later extended as a support
network computing. It was
designed with a goal of being easy
to use and accessible to a broader
audience.
Goto C++ supports
the goto statement.
Java doesn't support the goto
statement.
Multiple
inheritance
C++ supports multiple
inheritance.
Java doesn't support multiple
inheritance through class. It can be
achieved by interfaces in java.
Operator
Overloading
C++ supports operator
overloading.
Java doesn't support operator
overloading.
Pointers C++ supports pointers. You
can write pointer program in
C++.
Java supports pointer internally.
However, you can't write the
pointer program in java. It means
java has restricted pointer support
in java.
Compiler and
Interpreter
C++ uses compiler only.
C++ is compiled and run
using the compiler which
converts source code into
machine code so, C++ is
platform dependent.
Java uses compiler and interpreter
both. Java source code is
converted into bytecode at
compilation time. The interpreter
executes this bytecode at runtime
and produces output. Java is
interpreted that is why it is
platform independent.
Call by Value
and Call by
reference
C++ supports both call by
value and call by reference.
Java supports call by value only.
There is no call by reference in
java.
Structure and
Union
C++ supports structures and
unions.
Java doesn't support structures and
unions.
Thread Support C++ doesn't have built-in
support for threads. It relies
on third-party libraries for
thread support.
Java has built-in thread support.
Documentation
comment
C++ doesn't support
documentation comment.
Java supports documentation
comment (/** ... */) to create
documentation for java source
code.
Virtual
Keyword
C++ supports virtual
keyword so that we can
decide whether or not
override a function.
Java has no virtual keyword. We
can override all non-static
methods by default. In other
words, non-static methods are
virtual by default.
unsigned right
shift >>>
C++ doesn't support >>>
operator.
Java supports unsigned right shift
>>> operator that fills zero at the
top for the negative numbers. For
positive numbers, it works same
like >> operator.
Inheritance Tree C++ creates a new
inheritance tree always.
Java uses a single inheritance tree
always because all classes are the
child of Object class in java. The
object class is the root of
the inheritance tree in java.
Hardware C++ is nearer to hardware. Java is not so interactive with
hardware.
Object-oriented C++ is an object-oriented
language. However, in C
language, single root
hierarchy is not possible.
Java is also an objectoriented language. However,
everything (except fundamental
types) is an object in Java. It is a
single root hierarchy as everything
gets derived from
java.lang.Object.
Listed below are some major C++ features that were intentionally omitted from java or
significantly modified.
❖ Java does not support operator overloading.
❖ Java does not have template classes as in C++.
❖ Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes. This is accomplished using a new
feature called “Interface”.
❖ Java does not support global variables. Every variable and method is declared within
classes and forms part of that class.
❖ Java does not use pointers.
❖ Java has replaced the destructor function with a finalize() function.
❖ There are no header files in Java.
9. Java and Internet
❖ Java is strongly associated with the internet because of the first application program is
written in Java was hot Java.
❖ Web browsers to run applets on the internet.
❖ Internet users can use Java to create applet programs & run then locally using a Javaenabled browser such as hot Java.
❖ Java applets have made the internet a true extension of the storage system of the local
computer.
10. Java and www
❖ Java communicates with a web page through a special tag called applet.
❖ Java user sends a request for an HTML document to the remote computers net browser.
❖ The web-browser is a program that accepts a request, processes the request and sends the
required documents.
❖ The HTML document is returned to that user browser.
❖ The document contains the applet tag which identifies the applet. The corresponding applet
is transferred to the user computer.
❖ The Java enabled browser on the user's computer interprets the byte code and provide
output.
11. Web Browsers
The internet is a vast sea of information represented in many formats and stored on many
computers. a browser is a software application used to locate, retrieve and display content on the
World Wide Web, including Web pages, images, video and other files. As a client/server model,
the browser is the client run on a computer that contacts the Web server and requests information.
The Web server sends the information back to the Web browser which displays the results.
The browser application retrieves or fetches code, usually written in HTML (HyperText Markup
Language) and/or another language, from a web server, interprets this code, and renders (displays)
it as a Web page for you to view. on the computer or another Internet-enabled device that supports
a browser.
An example of Web Browsers:
❖ Hot Java
❖ Netscape Navigator
❖ Internet Explorer
❖ Google Chrome
12. Overview of Java: simple Java program
To create a simple java program, you need to create a class that contains the main method.
The requirement for Java Hello World Example
For executing any java program, you need to
o Install the JDK if you don't have installed it, download the JDK and install it.
o Set path of the jdk/bin directory
o Create the java program
o Compile and run the java program
Creating Hello World Example
Let's create the hello java program:
❖ class Simple{
❖ public static void main(String args[]){
❖ System.out.println("Hello Java");
❖ }
❖ }
To compile: javac Simple.java
To execute: java Simple
Output:Hello Java
Compilation Flow:
When we compile Java program using javac tool, java compiler converts the source code into byte
code.
13. Structure
Structure of a java program is the standard format released by Language developer to the
Industry programmer.
A Java program involves the following sections:
• Documentation Section
• Package Statement
• Import Statements
• Interface Statement
• Class Definition
• Main Method Class
• Main Method Definition
Sun Micro System has prescribed the following structure for the java programmers for
developing java application.
❖ A package is a collection of classes, interfaces and sub-packages. A sub package
contains collection of classes, interfaces and sub-sub packages etc. java.lang.*; package
is imported by default and this package is known as default package.
❖ Class is keyword used for developing user defined data type and every java program
must start with a concept of class.
❖ "ClassName" represent a java valid variable name treated as a name of the class each
and every class name in java is treated as user-defined data type.
❖ Data member represents either instance or static they will be selected based on the
name of the class.
❖ User-defined methods represents either instance or static they are meant for performing
the operations either once or each and every time.
❖ Each and every java program starts execution from the main() method. And hence
main() method is known as program driver.
❖ Since main() method of java is not returning any value and hence its return type must
be void.
❖ Since main() method of java executes only once throughout the java program execution
and hence its nature must be static.
❖ Since main() method must be accessed by every java programmer and hence whose
access specifier must be public.
❖ Each and every main() method of java must take array of objects of String.
❖ Block of statements represents set of executable statements which are in term calling
user-defined methods are containing business-logic.
❖ The file naming conversion in the java programming is that which-ever class is containing
main() method, that class name must be given as a file name with an extension .java.
14. Java Tokens
Java Tokens are the smallest individual building block or smallest unit of a Java program; the Java
compiler uses it for constructing expressions and statements. Java program is a collection of
different types of tokens, comments, and white spaces.
When we write a program, we need different important things. We require language tokens, white
spaces, and formats.
There are various tokens used in Java:
❖ Reserved Keywords
❖ Identifiers
❖ Literals
❖ Operators
❖ Separators
White space is also considered as a token.
15. Statements
A statement specifies an action in a Java program, such as assigning the sum of x and y to z,
printing a message to the standard output, writing data to a file, etc.
Statements in Java can be broadly classified into three categories:
❖ Declaration statement
❖ Expression statement
❖ Control flow statement
Declaration Statement
A declaration statement is used to declare a variable. For example,
int num;
int num2 = 100;
String str;
Expression Statement
An expression with a semicolon at the end is called an expression statement. For example,
/Increment and decrement expressions
num++;
++num;
num--;
--num;
//Assignment expressions
num = 100;
num *= 10;
//Method invocation expressions
System.out.println("This is a statement");
Methodname(param1, param2);
Control Statements
❖ Conditional execution
❖ Looping
Types of Conditional Execution
❖ If Statement
❖ If – Else statement
❖ If- Else-if statement
❖ Switch statement
Types of Loop Execution
❖ While
❖ For
16. Java Virtual Machine
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime
environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (i.e. JVM is platform dependent).
What is JVM?
❖ A specification where working of Java Virtual Machine is specified. But implementation
provider is independent to choose the algorithm. Its implementation has been provided by
Oracle and other companies.
❖ An implementation Its implementation is known as JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
❖ Runtime Instance Whenever you write java command on the command prompt to run the
java class, an instance of JVM is created.
What JVM does?
The JVM performs following operation:
❖ Loads code
❖ Verifies code
❖ Executes code
❖ Provides runtime environment
JVM provides definitions for the:
❖ Memory area
❖ Class file format
❖ Register set
❖ Garbage-collected heap
❖ Fatal error reporting etc.
1) ClassLoader
The class loader is a subsystem used for loading class files. It performs three major functions viz.
Loading, Linking, and Initialization.
2) Method Area
JVM Method Area stores class structures like metadata, the constant runtime pool, and the code
for methods.
3) Heap
All the Objects, their related instance variables, and arrays are stored in the heap. This memory is
common and shared across multiple threads.
4) JVM language Stacks
Java language Stacks store local variables, and it’s partial results. Each thread has its own JVM
stack, created simultaneously as the thread is created. A new frame is created whenever a method
is invoked, and it is deleted when method invocation process is complete.
5) PC Registers
PC register store the address of the Java virtual machine instruction which is currently executing.
In Java, each thread has its separate PC register.
6) Native Method Stacks
Native method stacks hold the instruction of native code depends on the native library. It is written
in another language instead of Java.
7) Execution Engine
It is a type of software used to test hardware, software, or complete systems. The test execution
engine never carries any information about the tested product.
8) Native Method interface
The Native Method Interface is a programming framework. It allows Java code which is running
in a JVM to call by libraries and native applications.
9) Native Method Libraries
Native Libraries is a collection of the Native Libraries(C, C++) which are needed by the Execution
Engine.
